WHY IS STOCK MARKET FALLING TODAY?
"As the US tariffs are going to kick start, the market is witnessing some kind of nervousness at this point of time and also, as long as the Nifty drifts below 25000 level, some kind of weakness is persistent in the market. These are the reasons for the market to be in the negative territory at this point of time," said Kranthi Bathini, Director - Equity strategy. WealthMills Securities Pvt Ltd.

"Ahead of the holiday, investors and traders are trying to be on sideways at this point of time. Mainly gems and jewelries, textile, aqua, these are the companies mostly affected right now," he added.

Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited, said that despite sluggish earnings growth and headwinds like high tariffs, the market continues to be resilient.

He explained that resilient market co-existing with tepid earnings growth has made India the most expensive market in the world.

"FIIs have been sustained sellers; but massive DII buying totally eclipsing FII selling is supporting the market even amidst strong headwinds. Since the principal reason for the marketâ€™s resilience is liquidity and liquidity flows are likely to sustain, the market is unlikely to correct significantly and the elevated valuations may continue. As a measure of abundant caution, investors may avoid unjustifiably expensive smallcaps and focus on largecaps which are reasonably fairly valued," said Vijayakumar.
